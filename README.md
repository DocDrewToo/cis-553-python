## Pipenv

[pipenv](pipenv.pypa.io) is a python package management tool that builds on top of `pip`. It installs packages from the same place as `pip` (pypi.org). Its main benefit over pip is that it also handles virtual environment management and dependency pinning. _real python_, an awesome website with great python tutorials, has a [pipenv tutorial](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/) that will probably be useful for anyone picking up pipenv for the first time.

### MacOS Pipenv setup

`brew install pipenv`

### linux Pipenv setup

1. [Install `pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer#installation--update--uninstallation)
2. Install python 3.7 w/ pyenv: `pyenv install 3.7.7 && pyenv global 3.7.7`
3. Install pipenv: `python3.7 -m pip install pipenv`

`python3 -m pip install pipenv`

### windows pipenv setup

1. [Install python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/)
2. `py -3.7 -m pip install pipenv`

note: windows is a bit tricky, due to path issues. The python.org python installer doesn't add everything to your path that you would normally expect. For that reason, you will probably need to run `py -3.7 -m pipenv <commands...>`.

## {pipenv_cmd}

Due to differences between various operating systems, the preferred way of invoking CLI packages like pipenv will be different. Here are some ways to invoke pipenv in different OSes:

### üçé Mac {pipenv_cmd}

If you used `brew` to install pipenv, you can just invoke pipenv as below:

`pipenv <args>`

### üêß Linux {pipenv_cmd}

`pipenv` might be on your path, but if you installed it into one of your `pyenv` environments, you'll need to invoke it as below:

`python3.7 -m pipenv <args>`

### windows {pipenv_cmd}

If you installed pipenv into a python.org python installation, you might need to invoke it as below:

`py -3.7 -m pipenv <args>`

## Installing dependencies

To install this project's dependencies, navigate to the root folder and run

```bash
{pipenv_cmd} install
```

note: `{pipenv_cmd}` [depends on your OS / pipenv installation](#-pipenv_cmd)

## Every time you open a terminal

Once you've [created your virtual environment with pipenv](#installing-dependencies), pipenv provides a helper command for "activating" your virtual environment

```bash
{pipenv_cmd} shell
```

## Adding new packages

You _can_ `pip install` after activating your pipenv environment, but then you'll need to manually edit your Pipfile if you want to track those changes. For that reason, it's better to use the `pipenv install` command again. For example, to install pandas-1., I would run

```bash
{pipenv_cmd} install "pandas>0,<2"
```

The `pipenv install` command (üëÜ) will install the specified package / packages, and add it to your 


# Run a local version

Run the flask app:

```flask run``` or ```python3 run.py```

# Run tests

###Execute all tests:

The included testing framework is pytest and the dev dependencies will need to be installed, in order to use it.

Install the dev dependencies by executing the following command:

```pipenv install --dev```

Then, run the tests with this command:

```pytest```

### Swagger API Documentation for your project

Your running app's swagger UI is served on endpoint:

```/swagger-ui```

Your running app's swagger JSON doc is served on endpoint:

```/api-docs```

# Database

## Pre-load the data

A file `mongodb_data.json` contains test data that can be loaded into the mongo database

To insert test data into the mongo db:  
```shell
python3 preload-data.py insert
```

To delete the test data (from the `mongodb_data.json` file):  
```shell
python3 preload-data.py delete
```
